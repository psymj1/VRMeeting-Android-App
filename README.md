This repo is for -- VR Meeting. <br>
------

Weâ€™re on the mission to develop a VR meeting app for Android to allow for organisations to conduct meetings and present information, all while avoiding the inconvenience and expense of travel.  With the aid of an in-expensive phone-case VR system, our app will allow employees to participate in a meeting all within a virtual reality environment from anywhere in the world
